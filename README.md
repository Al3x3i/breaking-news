## breaking-news project
Breaking news project.

## How to use

### Run a Spring Boot App with Maven
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Create breaking news analysis
```
curl --location --request POST 'localhost:8080/analyse/new' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '[
    "https://news.google.com/news?cf=all&hl=en&pz=1&ned=us&output=rss",
    "https://www.espn.com/espn/rss/news"
]'
```
### Find the frequency of words in the titles of RSS feeds that are in the generated `breaking news analysis`
```
curl --location --request GET 'localhost:8080/frequency/1' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '["https://news.google.com/news?cf=all&hl=en&pz=1&ned=us&output=rss", "https://rss.msn.com/en-us"]'
```

## Project consists of the following elements:
    - Maven Project
    - Spring boot 2.4.0
    - HATEOS 1.0.0
    - Java 11
    - H2 Database
    - Lombok
    - ROME library â€“ For parsing feeds (https://github.com/rometools/rome)
    - OpenNLP library
    
## Architecture decisions
### ROOM library
Basically it was the fastest solution to fetch RSS feeds and get titles per each item in news.
You can find more about ROME library here:

#### What to improve, do not load a whole document into memory. `SAX Parser` is suitable option.

#### Other options for working with XML documents
Other options for parsing XML documents are listed here: https://www.baeldung.com/java-xml

### OpenNLP library
The OpenNLP is used to extract noun phrases from a singular sentence.
This project supports only English sentences.

### Use ExecutorService
Analyse Rss titles asynchronously.

### Hints:
#### H2 database client
Use
`@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.DEFINED_PORT)` \
Client http://localhost:8080/h2-console
